# Codon_Variants
This perl script generates three different nucleotide sequences from a amino acid sequence. The codon diversity of the three nucleotide sequences generated is maximized.
This perl script takes two input files "arabidopsiscodon1.txt contiaing the codon frequencies found in Arabidopsis and the Ypet_aa.txt file thta contains the amino acid sequence of the protein that we want to use.
The output is a text file with three nucleotide variants for the protein of interest.
